Built using Microsoft Excel 2010, this spreadsheet produces simple data models such as leaderboards dependent on different criteria. This spreadsheet stores tournament data, including participantsâ€™ details and their performance data within the tournament, along with match results. From all of these data, the spreadsheet also automatically generates reports such as team standings and leaderboards that highlight extraordinary players.
